# Walkthrough: Residence Lotinor - AI Residential Management

I have successfully rebranded and refined the platform to **Residence Lotinor**, ensuring all visual elements are perfectly scaled and aligned with your vision.

## 🟢 Lotinor Rebranding & UI Refinement
- **Perfect Logo Scaling**: I have implemented the necessary utility classes to fix the oversized logo issue, ensuring it fits elegantly within the sidebar.
- **Custom Color Palette**: A premium "Nature-Tech" theme using greens from the Lotinor logo (`#4B632D`, `#9DC14B`, `#D4E157`).
- **Premium Dashboard**: A state-of-the-art interface with glassmorphic cards, real-time stats, and a focus on transparency.

## 🎙️ AI Voice Agent (Lotinor Edition)
- **Darija & French Support**: Simulated voice processing for resident requests in Moroccan Darija and French.
- **Automated Workflow**: Real-time ticket generation for maintenance and cleaning tasks.

## 📊 Dashboard Insights
- **Collection Rate**: Visualized at 96.8% for the residence.
- **Maintenance Pulse**: Real-time tracking of local contractors (Lotinor Green Team, H2O Tangier).
